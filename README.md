# Library Work with .Net Core 

I wanted to share a small project with you that runs entirely in the terminal. In my project, I implemented basic functionalities for adding, deleting, and updating books using .NET Core and MySQL. Any feedback is important to me. This is an example project for those who want to improve themselves with .Net Core.
