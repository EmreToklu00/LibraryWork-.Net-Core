While learning .NET, I wanted to share a small project with you that runs entirely in the terminal. As I'm in the process of learning .NET, I wanted to start with small projects to practice.In my project, I implemented basic functionalities for adding, deleting, and updating books using .NET Core and MySQL. Since I'm new to .NET, there might be some shortcomings. I would be grateful if you could provide me with feedback on them.
